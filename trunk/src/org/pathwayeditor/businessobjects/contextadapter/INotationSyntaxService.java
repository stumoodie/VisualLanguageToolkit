/**
 * Defines the context adapter syntax service. Implementations of this interfaces should define the visual
 * look of the glyphs in the notation and its syntactic rules. This is done by providing implementations 
 * of IShapeObjectType and ILinkObjectType and an IRootMapObject for the map.
 * <p>
 * The API provides methods for accessing the object types so created, which are then used to define new
 * map objects and the notation's syntactic rules.
 * <p>
 * The object type also controls which properties of its associated map object are editable. It also
 * defines additional annotation properties, which again may be editable and also displayed as a label 
 * associated with the map object (visualisable).
 * 
 * Typically this interface will be implemented behind an eclipse extension point and should have minimal
 * dependencies on the business object API of EPE.
