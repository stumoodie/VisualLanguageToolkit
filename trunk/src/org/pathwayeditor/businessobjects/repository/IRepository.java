/**
 * The repository that holds all the folders and maps (including the map
 * diagrams) used in EPE. It is essentially a storage location and would usually
 * correspond to a physical storage location. It is envisaged that in the future
 * EPE may have multiple repositories corresponding to other physical locations
 * (for example on central servers) of pathway maps. At present one would expect
 * only one repository to be present per schema, but there may be reasons to
 * store multiple repositories in a schema (at least temporarily) that we
 * haven't thought of yet.
 * 
 * The repository holds repository items (folders and maps) that are identified
 * uniquely within the repository by an inode. This is analogous to the UNIX
 * file system It also has the important benefit that the natural key (and
 * therefore hashCode and equals) of maps and folders does not vary if they are
 * moved into different sub-folders or renamed etc.
