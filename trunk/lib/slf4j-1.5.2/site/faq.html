      <dd>
        <p>SLF4J is a simple facade for logging systems allowing the
        end-user to plug-in the desired logging system at deployment
        time.
        </p>
          
        <hr />
      </dd>

      <dt><a name="when" href="#when"> When should SLF4J be used?
      </a></dt>
      
      <dd>
        <p>In short, libraries and other embedded components should
        consider SLF4J for their logging needs because libraries
        cannot afford to impose their choice of logging system on the
        end-user. On the other hand, it does not necessarily make
        sense for stand-alone applications to use SLF4J. Stand-alone
        applications can invoke the logging system of their choice
        directly.
       </p>

        <p>SLF4J is only a facade, meaning that it does not provide a
        complete logging solution. Operations such as configuring
        appenders or setting logging levels cannot be performed with
        SLF4J. Thus, at some point in time, any non-trivial
        application will need to directly invoke the underlying
        logging system. In other words, complete independence from the
        API underlying logging system is not possible for a
        stand-alone application. Nevertheless, SLF4J reduces the
        impact of this dependence to near-painless levels.
       </p>

       <p>Suppose that your CRM application uses log4j for its
       logging. However, one of your important clients request that
       logging be performed through JDK 1.4 logging. If your
       application is riddled with thousands of direct log4j calls,
       migration to JDK 1.4 would be a long and error-prone
       process. Had you been invoking SLF4J API instead of log4j, the
       migration could be completed in a matter of minutes instead of
       hours.
       </p>

       <p>SLF4J lets component developers to defer the choice of the
       logging system to the end-user but eventually a choice needs
       to be made.
       </p>

        <a name="yet_another_facade" href="#yet_another_facade">
        Is SLF4J yet another logging facade?  </a>
      </dt>

      <dd>
        <p>SLF4J is conceptually similar to JCL. As such, it can be
        thought of as yet another logging facade. However, SLF4J is
        orders of magnitude simpler in design and arguably more
        robust.
       </p>

       <hr />
       
      </dd>
      <dt>
        <a name="why_new_project" href="#why_new_project">
          If SLF4J fixes JCL, then why wasn't the fix made in JCL
          instead of creating a new project?
        </a>
       </dt>

       <dd>
         <p>This is a very good question. First, SLF4J static binding
         approach is very simple, perhaps even laughably so. It was
         not easy to convince developers of the validity of the
         approach. It is only after SLF4J was released and started to
         become accepted did the approach gain respectability in the
         relevant community.
       </p>

        <p>Second, SLF4J offers two enhancements which developers
        currently tend to underestimate. Parameterized log messages
        solve an important problem associated with logging performance
        in a pragmatic way. Marker objects, which are supported by the
        <code>org.slf4j.Logger</code> interface, pave the way for
        adoption of advanced logging systems and still leave the door
        open to switching back to more traditional logging systems if
        need be.

         to a different logging system?  </a>
       </dt>

       <dd>
         <p>No, you do not need to recompile your application. You can
         switch to a different logging system by removing the previous
         SLF4J binding and replacing it with the binding of your choice.
         </p>
         
         <p>For example, if you were using the NOP implementation and
         would like to switch to log4j version 1.2, simply replace
         <em>slf4j-nop.jar</em> with <em>slf4j-log4j12.jar</em> on
         your class path but do not forget to add log4j-1.2.x.jar as
         well. Want to switch to JDK 1.4 logging?  Just replace
         <em>slf4j-log4j12.jar</em> with <em>slf4j-jdk14.jar</em>.

         requirements?</a>
       </dt>

       <dd>

         <p>In principle, SLF4J requires JDK 1.3 or above, in
         particular slf4j-api is compatible with JDK 1.3.  However,
         the underlying logging system might have a higher
         requirement. For instance, the <em>slf4j-jdk14</em> binding
         requires JDK 1.4. Logback requires JDK 1.5.

        <p>Embedded components such as libraries do not need and

        invoke SLF4J to log but should let the end-user configure the

        logging on their own, they often override the end-user's
        wishes. At the end of the day, it is the end-user who has to
        read the logs and process them. She should be the person to
        decide how she wants her logging configured.

       <dd>
         <p>As an author of a library built with Maven2, you might
         want to test your application using a binding, say
         slf4j-log4j12 or logback-classic, without forcing log4j or
         logback-classic as a dependency upon your users. As of SLF4J
         version 1.3, this quite easy to accomplish. But first, since
         your library's code depends on the SLF4J API you will need to
         declare slf4j-api as a compile-time (default scope)
         dependency.
       </p>
       <p>&nbsp;</p>         
       <p class="source">&lt;dependency&gt;
  &lt;groupId&gt;org.slf4j&lt;/groupId&gt;
  &lt;artifactId&gt;slf4j-api&lt;/artifactId&gt;
  &lt;version&gt;1.5.2&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;</p>

       <p>&nbsp;</p>         

       <p>Limiting the transitivity of the SLF4J binding used in your
       tests can be accomplished by declaring the scope of the
       SLF4J-binding dependency as "test".  Here is an example:</p>

       <p>&nbsp;</p>         

       <p class="source">&lt;dependency&gt;
  &lt;groupId&gt;org.slf4j&lt;/groupId&gt;
  &lt;artifactId&gt;slf4j-log4j12&lt;/artifactId&gt;
  &lt;version&gt;1.5.2&lt;/version&gt;
  <b>&lt;scope&gt;test&lt;/scope&gt;</b>
&lt;/dependency&gt;</p>

        <p>Thus, as far as your users are concerned you are exporting
        slf4j-api as a transitive dependency of your library, but not
        any SLF4J-binding or an underlying logging system.

        <dt><a name="string_or_object" href="#string_or_object"> Why
        don't the printing methods in the Logger interface accept
        message of type Object, but only messages of type String?  </a>
        </dt>
        
        <dd>

          <p>In SLF4J 1.0beta4, the printing methods such as debug(),
          info(), warn(), error() in the <a
          href="api/org/slf4j/Logger.html">Logger interface</a> were
          modified so as to accept only messages of type String
          instead of Object.
          </p>

          <p>Thus, the set of printing methods for the DEBUG level
          became:</p>

        <p class="source">debug(String msg); 
debug(String format, Object arg); 
debug(String format, Object arg1, Object arg2);           
debug(String msg, Throwable t);</p>

       <p>Previously, the first argument in the above methods was of
       type <code>Object</code>.</p>

       <p>This change enforces the notion that logging systems are
       about decorating and handling messages of type String, and not
       any arbitrary type (Object).
       </p>

       <p>Just as importantly, the new set of method signatures offer
       a clearer differentiation between the overloaded methods
       whereas previously the choice of the invoked method due to
       Java overloading rules were not always easy to follow.</p>
       
       <p>It was also easy to make mistakes. For example, previously
       it was legal to write:</p>
       
       <p class="source">logger.debug(new Exception("some error"));</p>
        
       <p>Unfortunately, the above call did not print the stack trace
       of the exception. Thus, a potentially crucial piece of
       information could be lost. When the first parameter is
       restricted to be of type String, then only the method
       </p>
       
       <p class="source">debug(String msg, Throwable t)</p>
       
       <p>can be used to log exceptions. Note that this method
       ensures that every logged exception is accompanied with a
       descriptive message.</p>
       
       <hr />
        </dd>
        
        <dt>

          <a name="exception_message"  href="#exception_message">
            Can I log an exception without an accompanying message?
          </a>
        </dt>
        <dd>
          <p>In short, no.</p>
          
          <p>If <code>e</code> is an <code>Exception</code>, and you
          would like to log an exception at the ERROR level, you must
          add an accompanying message. For example,</p>
          
          <p class="source">logger.error("some accompanying message", e);</p>
        
          <p>You might correctly observe that not all exceptions have a
          meaningful message to accompany them. Moreover, a good
          exception should already contain a self explanatory
          description. The accompanying message may therefore be
          considered redundant.
          </p>


          <p>While these are valid arguments, there are three opposing
          arguments also worth considering. First, on many, albeit not
          all occasions, the accompanying message can convey useful
          information nicely complementing the description contained
          in the exception. Frequently, at the point where the
          exception is logged, the developer has access to more
          contextual information than at the point where the exception
          is thrown. Second, it is not difficult to imagine more or
          less generic messages, e.g. "Exception caught", "Exception
          follows", that can be used as the first argument for
          <code>error(String msg, Throwable t)</code> invocations.
          Third, most log output formats display the message on a
          line, followed by the exception on a separate line. Thus,
          the message line would look inconsistent without a message.
          </p>

          <p>In short, if the user were allowed to log an exception
          without an accompanying message, it would be the job of the
          logging system to invent a message. This is actually what
          the <a href="http://tinyurl.com/cr9kg">throwing(String
          sourceClass, String sourceMethod, Throwable thrown)</a>
          method in java.util.logging package does. (It decides on its
          own that accompanying message is the string "THROW".)
          </p>
        
          <p>It may initially appear strange to require an accompanying
          message to log an exception. Nevertheless, this is common
          practice in <em>all</em> log4j derived systems such as
          java.util.logging, logkit, etc. and of course log4j itself. It
          seems that the current consensus considers requiring an
          accompanying message as a good a thing (TM).

        What is the fastest way of (not) logging?</a></dt><dd>

        <p>SLF4J supports an advanced feature called parameterized
        logging which can significantly boost logging performance for
        <em>disabled</em> logging statement.</p>

        <p> For some Logger <code>logger</code>, writing,</p>
        <p class="source">logger.debug("Entry number: " + i + " is " + String.valueOf(entry[i]));</p>
        
        <p>incurs the cost of constructing the message parameter, that
        is converting both integer <code>i</code> and
        <code>entry[i]</code> to a String, and concatenating
        intermediate strings. This, regardless of whether the message
        will be logged or not.
        </p>        

        <p>One possible way to avoid the cost of parameter
        construction is by surrounding the log statement with a
        test. Here is an example.</p>

        <p class="source">if(logger.isDebugEnabled()) {
  logger.debug("Entry number: " + i + " is " + String.valueOf(entry[i]));
}</p>


       <p>This way you will not incur the cost of parameter
       construction if debugging is disabled for
       <code>logger</code>. On the other hand, if the logger is
       enabled for the DEBUG level, you will incur the cost of
       evaluating whether the logger is enabled or not, twice: once in
       <code>debugEnabled</code> and once in <code>debug</code>.  This
       is an insignificant overhead because evaluating a logger takes
       less than 1% of the time it takes to actually log a statement.
       </p>

       <p><b>Better alternative based on parameterized
        messages</b></p>
        
        <p>There exists a very convenient alternative based on message
        formats. Assuming <code>entry</code> is an object, you can write:
       </p>
        
        
       <p class="source">Object entry = new SomeObject();
logger.debug("The entry is {}.", entry);</p>
        
       <p>After evaluating whether to log or not, and only if the
       decision is affirmative, will the logger implementation format
       the message and replace the '{}' pair with the string value of
       <code>entry</code>. In other words, this form does not incur
       the cost of parameter construction in case the log statement is
       disabled.
       </p>
       
 
       <p>The following two lines will yield the exact same
       output. However, the second form will outperform the first
       form by a factor of at least 30, in case of a
       <em>disabled</em> logging statement.
       </p>
       
        <p class="source">logger.debug("The new entry is "+entry+".");
logger.debug("The new entry is {}.", entry);</p>
   
   
        <p>A two argument variant is also available. For example, you
        can write:</p>
        
        
        <p class="source">logger.debug("The new entry is {}. It replaces {}.", entry, oldEntry);</p>

        <p></p>  
        <p>If three or more arguments need to be passed, you can make
        use of the <code>Object[]</code> variant. For example, you can
        write:</p>

        <p>        </p>
        <p class="source">logger.debug("Value {} was inserted between {} and {}.", 
             new Object[] {newVal, below, above});</p>
        
        <p></p>             
        <p>SLF4J uses its own message formatting implementation which
        differs from that of the Java platform. This is justified by
        the fact that SLF4J's implementation performs several orders
        of magnitude faster but at the cost of being non-standard and
        less flexible.

          <p> In relatively rare cases where the message to be logged

          certain complexity, for a log statement of level DEBUG, you
          can write:
          </p>

          <p class="source">logger.debug("{}", complexObject);</p>


          <p>The logging system will invoke
          <code>complexObject.toString()</code> method only after it
          has ascertained that the log statement was
          enabled. Otherwise, the cost of
          <code>complexObject.toString()</code> conversion will be
          advantageously avoided.

        <dd>
        
          <p>From the stand point of a logging system, the distinction
          between a fatal error and an error is usually not very
          useful. Most programmers exit the application when a fatal
          error is encountered. However, a logging library cannot (and
          should not) decide on its own to terminate an
          application. The initiative to exit the application must be
          left to the developer.
          </p>


          <p>Thus, the most the FATAL level can do is to
          <em>highlight</em> a given error as the cause for
          application to crash. However, errors are by definition
          exceptional events that merit attention. If a given
          situation causes errors to be logged, the causes should be
          attended to as soon as possible. However, if the "error" is
          actually a normal situation which cannot be prevented but
          merits being aware of, then it should be marked as WARN, not
          ERROR.
          </p>
        
        <p>Assuming the ERROR level designates exceptional situations
        meriting close attention, we are inclined to believe that the
        FATAL level is superfluous.

        SLF4J version 1.4.0?
        </a>
      </dt>
        
      <dd>

        <p>The addition of the TRACE level has been frequently and
        hotly debated request. By studying various projects, we
        observed that the TRACE level was used to disable logging
        output from certain classes <em>without</em> needing to
        configure logging for those classes. Indeed, the TRACE level
        is by default disabled in log4j and logback as well most other
        logging systems. The same result can be achieved by adding the
        appropriate directives in configuration files.
        </p>

        <p>Thus, in many of cases the TRACE level carried the same
        semantic meaning as DEBUG. In such cases, the TRACE level
        merely saves a few configuration directives. In other, more
        interesting occasions, where TRACE carries a different meaning
        than DEBUG, <a href="api/org/slf4j/Marker.html">Marker</a>
        objects can be put to use to convey the desired
        meaning. However, if you can't be bothered with markers and
        wish to use a logging level lower than DEBUG, the TRACE level
        can get the job done.
        </p>

        <p>Note that while the cost of evaluating a disabled log
        request is in the order of a few <code>nanoseconds</code>, the
        use of the TRACE level (or any other level for that matter) is
        discouraged in tight loops where the log request might be
        evaluated millions of times. If the log request is enabled,
        then it will overwhelm the target destination with massive
        output. If the request is disabled, it will waste resources.
        </p>
      
        <p>In short, although we still discourage the use of the TRACE
        level because alternatives exist or because in many cases log
        requests of level TRACE are wasteful, given that people kept
        asking for it, we decided to bow to popular demand.

      </dt>
      

      <dd>

        <p>Adding supporting for the SLF4J is surprisingly
        easy. Essentially, you coping an existing binding and tailoring
        it a little (as explained below) does the trick.
        </p>

        <p>Assuming your logging system has notion of a
        logger, called say <code>MyLogger</code>, you need to provide
        an adapter for <code>MyLogger</code> to
        <code>org.slf4j.Logger</code> interface. Refer to slf4j-jcl,
        slf4j-jdk14, and slf4j-log4j12 modules for examples of
        adapters.
       </p>

        <p>Once you have written an appropriate adapter, say
        <code>MyLoggerAdapter</code>, you need to provide a factory
        class implementing the <code>org.slf4j.ILoggerFactory</code>
        interface. This factory should return instances
        <code>MyLoggerAdapter</code>. Let <code>MyLoggerFactory</code>
        be the name of your factory class.
       </p>

        <p>Once you have the adapter, namely
        <code>MyLoggerAdapter</code>, and a factory, namely
        <code>MyLoggerFactory</code>, the last remaining step is to
        modify the <code>StaticLoggerBinder</code> class so that it
        returns an new instance of <code>MyLoggerFactory</code>. You
        will also need to modify the
        <code>loggerFactoryClassStr</code> variable.
       </p>
        
        <p>For Marker or MDC support, you could use the one of the
        existing NOP implementations.
        </p>

        <p>In summary, to create an SLF4J binding for your logging
        system, follow these steps:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>start with a copy of an existing module,</li>
          <li>create an adapter between your logging system and
          <code>org.slf4j.Logger</code> interface
         </li>
          <li>create a factory for the adapter created in the previous step,</li>
          <li>>modify <code>StaticLoggerBinder</code> class to use the
          factory you created in the previous step</li>
       </ol>

          <p>Markers constitute a revolutionary concept which is
          supported by logback but not other existing logging
          systems. Consequently, SLF4J conforming logging systems are
          allowed to ignore marker data passed by the user.
          </p>

        <p>However, even though marker data may be ignored, the user
        must still be allowed to specify marker data. Otherwise, users
        would not be able to switch between logging systems that
        support markers and those that do not.  In order to provide
        minimal support for markers, SLF4J conforming systems need to
        to include certain Marker related classes, namely,
        <code>org.slf4j.Marker</code>,
        <code>org.slf4j.IMarkerFactory</code>,
        <code>org.slf4j.MarkerFactory</code>,
        <code>org.slf4j.impl.BasicMarker</code>,
        <code>org.slf4j.impl.BasicMarkerFactory</code>,
        <code>org.slf4j.impl.MarkerIgnoringBase</code>,
        <code>org.slf4j.impl.StaticMarkerBinder</code> and
        <code>org.slf4j.spi.MarkerFactoryBinder</code>. Al of these
        classes are available in the SLF4J subversion repository.
       </p>

        <p>The <code>MarkerIgnoringBase</code> class can serve as a
        base for adapters or native implementations of logging systems
        lacking marker support. In <code>MarkerIgnoringBase</code>,
        methods taking marker data simply invoke the corresponding
        method without the Marker argument, discarding any Marker data
        passed as argument. Your SLF4J adapters can extend
        <code>MarkerIgnoringBase</code> to quickly implement the
        methods in <code>org.slf4j.Logger</code> which take a
        <code>Marker</code> as the first argument.

      <h3>Explanation</h3>

      <p>Static logger members cost a single variable reference for
      all instances of the class whereas an instance logger member
      will cost a variable reference for every instance of the
      class. For simple classes instantiated thousands of times
      there might be a noticeable difference.
      </p>
      
      <p>However, more recent logging systems, e.g log4j or logback,
      support a distinct logger context for each application running
      in the application server. Thus, even if a single copy of
      <em>log4j.jar</em> or <em>logback-classic.jar</em> is deployed
      in the server, the logging system will be able to differentiate
      between applications and offer a distinct logging environment
      for each application.
      </p>

      <p>More specifically, each time a logger is retrieved by
      invoking <code>LoggerFactory.getLogger()</code> method, the
      underlying logging system will return an instance appropriate
      for the current application. Please note that within the
      <em>same</em> application retrieving a logger by a given name
      will always return the same logger. For a given name, a
      different logger will be returned only for different
      applications.
      </p>

      <p>If the logger is static, then it will only be retrieved once
      when the hosting class is loaded into memory. If the hosting
      class is used in only in one application, there is not much to
      be concerned about. However, if the hosting class is shared
      between several applications, then all instances of the shared
      class will log into the context of the application which
      happened to fist load the shared class into memory - hardly the
      behavior expected by the user.
      </p>

      <p>Unfortunately, for non-native implementations of the SLF4J
      API, namely with slf4j-log4j12, log4j's repository selector will
      not be able to do its job properly because slf4j-log4j12, a
      non-native SLF4J binding, will store logger instances in a map,
      short-circuiting context-dependent logger retrieval. For native
      SLF4J implementations, such as logback-classic, repository
      selectors will work as expected.

      <p><b>Logger serialization</b></p>

      <p>Contrary to static variables, instance variables are
      serialized by default. However, the org.sfl4j.Logger interface
      is not serializable nor are the logger classes in underlying
      logging systems such as java.util.logging, log4j or
      logback-classic.
      </p>


      <p><b>Summary</b></p>

      <p>In summary, declaring logger members as static variables
      requires less work, less CPU and memory overhead and causes no
      problems with serialization. On the other hand, declaring logger
      members as instance variables requires more work, more CPU and
      memory overhead and is likely to cause problems with
      serialization. However, instance variables make it possible to
      create a distinct logger environment for each application, even
      for loggers declared in shared libraries. Perhaps more important
      than previously mentioned considerations, instance variables are
      IOC-friendly whereas static variables are not.

      declaring a logger in a class?</a>
      </dt>

      <dd>
        <p>The following is the recommended logger declaration
        idiom. It assumes that your logger is a static variable of the
        class.</p>

        <p class="source">package some.package;
import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;

public class MyClass {
  <b>final static Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(MyClass.class);</b>
  ... etc
}</p>

        <p>Unfortunately, give that the name of the hosting class is
        part of the logger declaration, the above logger declaration
        idiom is not is <em>not</em> resistant to cut-and-pasting
        between classes.
