 * 
 * <p>If a rule is MANDATORY then it must always be validated and if the rule is invalid then this should be enforced as an error.
 *  A rule level of MANDATORY must always have an enforcement level of ERROR.</p>
 * 
 * <p>If a rule is OPTIONAL then it will be validated <b>unless</b> enforcement is set to IGNORE. If the rule is invalid
 * then this will be enforced as an error or warning depending on the <code>RuleEnforecement</code> setting. The default enforcement
 * is set in the definition, but the application may choose to change this via <code>IValidationRuleConfig</code>.
