 * The map is akin to a "file" in the repository. It holds content, which in this cases is the diagram. The content
 * of the map (the canvas) cannot be obtained directly from the map. This is because one is likely to want to load up the whole repository in
 * one go, but for reasons of memory and speed one would not want all the diagrams to be loaded too. This is not dissimilar to a file system
 * where a special operation is required to access the contents of the file.
