 * convex shape {@link <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_hull">definition here</a>}. It is typically used
 * as an approximation for a shape since once can perform a number of optimisations when calculating such queries as
 * intersection and point containment. This interface provides methods for interrogating it
 * and performing geometric queries. Note that the interface is designed to support an implementation that is immutable.
 * 
 * A convex hull must have a minimum of 3 points to be valid.
